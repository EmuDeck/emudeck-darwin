# EmuDeck darwin

## Developers, developers, developers.

If you wanna help us improve EmuDeck we are open to accept your PR! Just keep in mind this simple guide:

- Think that EmuDeck is for everybody, tech savvy and is specially directed to regular users that are new to Emulation, so everything has to be properly explained.
- Things using sudo are a big no no, there are exceptions but always try to find a way of prevent using sudo.
- Every Emulator needs to have a SRM profile and follow the AmberElec hotkey mapping.
- Always do your PR to the dev branch.
